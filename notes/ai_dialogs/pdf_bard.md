> To calculate this, we can use the following formula:

```
pdf = 1 / math.sqrt(2 * math.pi * sigma**2) * math.exp(-(x - mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2))
```

where:

- pdf is the probability distribution function value
- x is the value to evaluate the PDF at (in this case, 0.05)
- mu is the mean of the distribution (in this case, 0.1)
- sigma is the standard deviation of the distribution (in this case, 0.2)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

```
pdf = 1 / math.sqrt(2 * math.pi * 0.2**2) * math.exp(-(0.05 - 0.1)**2 / (2 * 0.2**2))
```

```
pdf = 1.9333405840142461
```

Therefore, the probability distribution function value for 0.05 in a normal
distribution with mu=0.1 and standard deviation of 0.2 is 1.9333405840142461.
